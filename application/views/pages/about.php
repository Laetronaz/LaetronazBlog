    user-friendly blog. As of now the project is still ongoing and will be for quite a while.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>In term of hobbies, I like learning about new technologies, so the devloppement of this blog is, in a way one of my hobbies, I also play some online and offline games.
Sometimes you will even see me streaming some events and stuff on my twitch channel, mostly World of Warcraft stuff, beware however that it's heavily in french due to the
fact that I'm a french canadian. Feel free to pay me a visit when I'm streaming.

<h3>Work History</h3>
<p>
    My work history might not be the most impressing, but I am a passinate of technologies and programming in general. I've done 3 internship and had a full time job as a 
    junoir programmer trough the years but I admit finding a job have in the domain have been a real struggle so far.
</p>
<h4>College Internships</h4>
<p>
    My first intership was with my college, cégep André-Laurendeau, as a support IT student level. The work was a support job for the administration personel and the 
    teaching staff of the college. Most of the work I did there was to replace old computer with new one and make sure the old one were package correctly to be sent in
    packages.

    <br><br>
    My second internship was at Céritar Technologies where I was a junior programmer. There I did an application conversion from Visual Basic 6 to a Visual Basic .net application
    with the help of another intern from my college. I touched a lot of VB.net through the internship and learned it that way, the main job was debugging the app so it would work
    as intended. As a lot of new "features" such as threads didn't exist back in VB6. It's was a lot of work as we had to convert over a hundread of screens but I beleive it has 
    been a necessary step to help hone my debugging skills.

<h4>University Internship</h4>
<p>
    I've done a intership a very facinating intership at Tecsys.inc as junior Research and Devloppement team member. I have worked in a Java Fullstack job to work on a plateform
    that have been devlopped to manage docker applications of Tecsys. The work was in three parts devlop and test new features for the web application. Devlop tests for the new
    Selenium test suite that was integrated with Jenkins to test the quality of the application. Lastly devlop a solution to deploy dockers outside of Amazon Cloud on a local
    Server. I've learned a lot in this intership about java, testing and even had the chance to test out new technology some which I still use today.

<h4>Work Experience</h4>
    After my internship at Céritar Technologies I was hired for around 5 months as a junior VB.net devlopper. I continued to work on the application transition from VB6 to VB.net
    but also worked on a .net web application and some ActiveReports conversion. I've learned about languages and tools I wasn't familliar with and managed to learn quite a few things
    I however had to leave for personal reasons at the time. Transportation was pretty aweful and I had school at the same time as the job, it wasn't a bad place at all but
    circonstance played against me.
